<!-- Humans write gate lines here, e.g.: 2026-09-23 GATE P0 PASS (name) -->

| 2026-09-22 | P0 | Inspect and preserve original 30-file kit; no existing repository/credentials found | IMPLEMENTED, local baseline only | 52b935e |
| 2026-09-22 | P0 | Narrow user-authorized Codex migration, conflict register, environment and resume | IMPLEMENTED; D-015; protected choices remain open | f87b1ed |
| 2026-09-22 | P0 0.3 | C++17 CMake/doctest scaffold and B16 defaults | HOST-TESTED: 1 smoke test, 4 assertions; all 77 defaults compared exactly; analysis/P0_host_tests.txt | commit containing this row |

2026-09-22 checkpoint: P0 remains active; no gates passed. User requested continuing
software while deferring hardware checks. Hardware assumptions remain unverified;
no STAND OK, RING OK, PINMAP OK, or human gate was provided.

| 2026-09-22 | P0 recovery 0.3/0.4 | Correct B16 extraction (76 defaults; remove unrelated FC), recover inert matrix/timing sketches, fix elapsed counter and add independent checks | HOST-TESTED: 11 focused checks plus host CTest 1/1; analysis/P0_scaffold_audit.md and P0_host_tests_recovery.txt; no target measurements | commit containing this row |

| 2026-09-22 | P0 recovery 0.2 | Recover SSH staging/compile/upload and receive-only log scripts; fix prerequisite/staging/symlink failures; bind inert upload to reviewed source | SCRIPT-TESTED: full suite 32/32, exit 0; analysis/P0_tool_tests_recovery.txt; separate-context software review PASS in reviews/P0_recovery_codex.md; no board contacted | commit containing this row |

| 2026-09-22 | P0 recovery 0.1 | Preserve/merge G1-G6 primary research; refresh tooling facts and add user-reported MPU6050 range/rate/library/timing analysis | SOURCE-REVIEWED; FACTS F-019–F-060; hardware/target pending; no candidate library adopted | commit containing this row |
| 2026-09-22 | P0 recovery checkpoint | Save independent review, exact resume dependencies and prepared gate request | Scaffold/diagnostics 7968434; tooling 720791d; host1/1 and combined32/32 pass; P0 stays HARDWARE-PENDING / GATE-PENDING | commit containing this row |

2026-09-22 recovery boundary: user reports MPU6050 and asks to assume the intended
setup because connection/setup details are unavailable. This is recorded as an
assumption, not hardware verification. No board operation, motor authorization,
PINMAP OK or human phase gate was provided. Next eligible task: read-only board
inventory when SSH details become available; resolve SC-I before Monitor demo.
No P1 strategy or P2 HAL work started. No remote publication occurred.

| 2026-09-22 | P0 0.2 manual-check preparation | Add read-only board inventory and independent default/Immediate bench startup selection; block Immediate matrix upload pending F-061 | SCRIPT-TESTED: 45/45 exit0; analysis/P0_preflight_tests.txt; separate-context review PASS in reviews/P0_preflight_codex.md; no board operation | commit containing this row |

| 2026-09-22 | P0 manual handoff | Publish ordered human checks and blank measurement worksheet; update resume for read-only preflight and F-061 | DOCUMENTED / REVIEWED; docs/P0_MANUAL_CHECKLIST.md; analysis/P0_MEASUREMENTS_TEMPLATE.md is not evidence; tooling98d4524 | commit containing this row |

2026-09-22 17:53 Asia/Dubai: latest active implementation phase is **P1 host-only**
under user-directed scheduling exception D-016. P0 hardware acceptance remains
pending; gates passed: **none**. This appended checkpoint supersedes the initial
active-phase label for implementation only, preserving all prior gate history.

| 2026-09-22 | P1 1.1 partial | Commit B0 types and standalone countdown, line-classifier and opponent-debounce interfaces before implementation/tests | CONTRACTS DEFINED; remaining module headers and recorder output contract deferred with protected conflicts; no behavior/physical acceptance claimed | commit containing this row |
